## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step by step on how to implement the features you see in the demo app. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

This repo is the starting point of our React client application.

Refactored by [lindseyk](http://lindseyk.dev)

To get started:

1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the React application and open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

> Note that the client will show an `ERROR: Failed to fetch` message unless you have the [counterpart GraphQL server](https://github.com/codelikeagirl29/odyssey-lift-off-server) running locally on `localhost:4000`.

To check the **final** stage of the client, with all of the steps and code completed, checkout the `final` branch by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git checkout final
```
